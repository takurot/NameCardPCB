# NameCardPCB
This is my business card PCB project.
- KiCAD project
- The letters are lit up from backside LEDs which are back entry type.
- ESP32 are implemented to light up LEDs and interact with a human detect sensor.
- ESP32 program is written from JST connector, but it requires external programmer like [this](https://www.switch-science.com/products/8121?_pos=3&_sid=626f88953&_ss=r)
- Power is supplied from type-C connector
- If you change the letters with Mask-F layer, you can make your own business card PCB.
